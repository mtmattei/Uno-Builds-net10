# Project Instructions

## Overview

Meridian Capital Terminal (Dark) — desktop stock market dashboard built on Uno Platform with MVUX, SkiaSharp, and Material theme. Single-page dashboard with portfolio tracking, per-stock chart drill-down, interactive watchlist, and mock trade execution drawer. All data is mock for v1. Desktop-first (Windows/macOS/Linux via Skia), WebAssembly as stretch goal.

This is the dark variant of `../Meridian` (which stays warm cream). Both build and run independently; only the palette layer differs.

## Dark Palette — "ink and brass"

The light theme is warm cream: printed paper. This one is its reverse printing, not a grayscale inversion. The ground is a warm brown-black at the same hue as the original cream, and the type is the cream that used to be the paper. Neutrals carry a brass undertone rather than being neutral gray, which is what keeps the surface reading as editorial duotone instead of a generic dark terminal.

Tokens live in `Themes/ColorPaletteOverride.xaml`. Contrast on the card ground (`#1E1B16`):

| Token | Value | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| `MeridianTextPrimary` | `#F2EDE3` | 14.7:1 |
| `MeridianTextMuted` | `#9C917C` | 5.5:1 |
| `MeridianTextSubtle` | `#736B5E` | 3.3:1 |
| `MeridianGain` | `#5CA87E` | 6.0:1 |
| `MeridianLoss` | `#DA6154` | 4.8:1 |
| `MeridianAccent` | `#D2B278` | 8.5:1 |

Rules specific to this variant:

- **`RequestedTheme="Dark"`** in App.xaml. Both theme dictionaries carry the dark values so resolution is correct either way.
- **Semantic gain/loss are lifted, so they are now light tones.** Anything drawn *on top* of them (button labels, chart badges) must use the ink `#15130F`, not white — white on the lifted green is 2.85:1.
- **Skia controls each hold their own `SKColor` constants** at the top of the file. They are not resource-bound; retint them there.
- **Lightweight-styling overrides for TextBox and Button are mandatory.** Without them the Windows system accent paints the focus ring and hover states straight through the palette.
- **Liveline is themed via `IsDark = true`**, whose dark branch was retuned to the warm ground so the chart sits flush in the card.

## Architecture

- Pattern: MVUX (Model-View-Update eXtended)
- Navigation: Single page — no multi-page routing. All state changes within DashboardPage.
- DI: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection via Uno.Extensions.Hosting
- Charting: Liveline (SKCanvasElement, project ref `../Liveline/Liveline.csproj`) for main chart. SkiaSharp custom for sparklines/sector ring/volume.
- Trade Drawer: DrawerFlyoutPresenter (Uno Toolkit)
- Timers: Consolidated single 32ms tick (~30fps) for scroll/braille animations, separate 1s clock
- Ticker Tape: Dual-TextBlock marquee (A/B leapfrog) with Grid.Clip

## Project Structure

- `Meridian/` — Single-project Uno Platform app
- `Meridian/Models/` — Immutable record types (Stock, Holding, Sector, etc.)
- `Meridian/Presentation/` — MVUX models (DashboardModel, TradeDrawerModel)
- `Meridian/Services/` — IMarketDataService + MockMarketDataService
- `Meridian/Controls/` — Custom UserControls and SKXamlCanvas controls
- `Meridian/Views/` — DashboardPage, TradeDrawer
- `Meridian/Themes/` — ColorPaletteOverride, FontResources, TextBlockStyles, CardStyles
- `Meridian/Assets/Fonts/` — Instrument Serif, IBM Plex Mono, Outfit .ttf files
- `Meridian/Strings/en/` — Localization resources

## Uno Platform Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **FontIcon on top of TextBox blocks input** even with `IsHitTestVisible="False"`. Render FontIcon FIRST, TextBox LAST. Use transparent TextBox bg + separate Border for visuals.
- **RenderTransform Y translate on hover causes jitter.** Don't use translate for hover effects on small elements. Use border/background color changes instead.
- **FontWeight="Thin" breaks Outfit font.** Use `SemiLight` (350) as minimum safe weight.
- **ShadowContainer is a XAML wrapper only.** Can't add/remove shadows from C# code-behind. Must wrap in `<utu:ShadowContainer>` in XAML.
- **PointerExited fires on selected elements.** Guard with `if (element == _selectedElement) return;` in PointerExited handlers.
- **ScrollViewer doesn't clip RenderTransform content.** Use `Grid.Clip` with `RectangleGeometry` (update rect on `SizeChanged`).
- **TextBlock Inlines (Runs) cause flicker on scroll reset.** For scrolling text, use plain `.Text`, never Inlines.
- **WinUI max element render width is ~16k pixels.** Don't create TextBlocks wider than ~10,000px. Use dual-TextBlock marquee pattern.
- **Mask reveal animations don't work.** Overlay Border with TranslateTransform doesn't composite correctly. Use chart library's built-in animation instead.
- **LiveCharts2 Y axis: `MinStep = range/N` gives N+2 labels.** Set `MinLimit`/`MaxLimit` and use `range/(desiredLabels-1)`.
- **StackPanel doesn't participate in Grid alignment.** Convert to Grid with Auto + * rows when bottom-alignment is needed.

## Conventions

- New pages get a corresponding partial record model in `Presentation/`.
- Use MVUX feeds/states — never raw INotifyPropertyChanged.
- Prefer Uno Toolkit controls (`NavigationBar`, `TabBar`, `AutoLayout`, `DrawerFlyoutPresenter`) over raw WinUI equivalents.
- Keep XAML lean — use Lightweight Styling and theme resources over inline values.
- Never hardcode hex colors — use `{StaticResource MeridianXxxBrush}` resources.
- Use `{StaticResource SectionLabel}` style for all card headers.
- Search Uno Platform docs via MCP before assuming API usage or patterns.

## Key References

Before starting any new feature or architectural decision, read these first:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture, layers, dependencies, implementation priority
- `docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md` — design language, spacing, color tokens, component patterns, ASCII layouts
- `docs/INTERACTION-SPEC.md` — state model, user flows, component states, animation inventory
- `docs/XAML-SCAFFOLD.md` — complete DashboardPage component tree, theme XAML, model code

## Verification

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Meridian/Meridian.csproj -f net10.0-desktop
```

Always run `dotnet build` after changes to confirm the project still compiles. Run tests when they exist.
